# Super Marios Pizza
This project is a fictional pizza website built using React and Typescript. It features multiple pages, including a home page, menu page, booking page, and contact page. All text on the website has been generated by ChatGPT. The website serves as an educational project to explore React and Typescript for building web applications. This is my first project using React.
